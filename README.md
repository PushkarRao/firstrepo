# firstrepo
First simple repository 
Definitions :
A repository 
//basically a tree with sub aspects like bark,leaves,fruit,branches.
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Branch
//as it is named, branch is a sub aspect of tree. Trunk of a tree can be said to be "master"(initial | basic | default)
//new branches can be created and named(say randbranch)
//randbranch is not default and user defined.
//Different but connect to | coming from master/trunk
//diffrent user can change branch forming a new branch.
// randbranch if edited by X and named randbranchX is different than randbranch because X changed something

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Commit

//basically saving the branch
//commit message is important as is has the changes made in that specific commit(userdef)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Pull Request
// basically asking if changes made in randbranchX were acceptable.
// discussion over randbranchX changes
// will show difference is randbranch and randbranchX in RED,GREEN

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally..
A Merge
// Merge is officially/acutally accepting the changes in randbranchX by the master/trunk and deleting randbranch.
